<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All-time:</h2>
<hr />
<h3><u>Forrest Gump:</u></h3>
<P>The direction, the editng, the soundtrack are mesmerising, but Tom Hank's acting is a pure master piece.</P>
<h3><u>Toys Story:</h3></u>
<p>I still get the goospbumps when remembering being at the movies in Colombia and witnessing this magic</p>
<h3><u>V For Vendetta:</h3></u>
<p> Semi Sci-fi, but highly realistic and relevant to our present day. It's full of action with AMAZING dialogues.</p>
